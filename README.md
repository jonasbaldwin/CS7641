# ML

This is code I did for CS 7641. In order to turn in the projects I needed a repository that allows graders to see the code I used 
to analyze different datasets. You can use this code for anything you like, but as per the syllubus, it is expressly prohibited
to be used for Georgia Techs CS 7641 Machine learning class.

## Projects

There are four projects in the class. The first is located in the `p1` directory and each has a `requirements.txt` file with
instructions for running it.
